# Sangsom Mini-Me Project Development Guide

## Project Overview
- **Educational 3D Tamagotchi**: Students care for personalized Mini-Me characters through homework completion
- **Minime Universe**: Expandable ecosystem with educational side games feeding resources to main character
- **Blender + Cursor AI**: Modern AI-assisted development with automated code generation
- **Target**: Schools/educators with multi-user account management

## Core Development Principles

### Character System
- **Anime-style 3D models** generated from 2-3 reference photos
- **Scalable customization**: Eye size sliders, outfits, accessories, jewelry
- **Animation requirements**: Dance, wave, wai, curtsy, bow movements
- **Student-specific folders**: `Assets/Characters/{StudentName}/`

### Educational Integration
- **Homework completion** drives character well-being and resources
- **No timers or stress mechanics** - focus on nurturing, cozy gameplay
- **Resource system**: Coins from homework, gems from excellence
- **Cross-game currency** from Minime Universe side games

### Technical Architecture
- **Multi-structural folders** for performance optimization
- **Administrative access** with password protection for teachers
- **Multi-user account system** supporting entire schools
- **Modular design** allowing post-launch content expansion

## File Organization Standards

### Assets Structure
```
Assets/
├── Characters/{StudentName}/
│   ├── Photos/          # Reference images for AI model generation
│   ├── Models/          # Generated 3D models and textures
│   └── Animations/      # Custom animation controllers
├── Minime-Universe/
│   ├── Core-Game/       # Main tamagotchi systems
│   └── Side-Games/      # Educational mini-games
├── Resources/
│   ├── Outfits/         # Purchasable clothing items
│   └── Accessories/     # Hats, jewelry, special items
└── Scripts/
    ├── Core/            # Game management, save systems
    ├── Character/       # Character behavior and customization
    ├── UI/              # Interface and menu systems
    └── Educational/     # Homework integration and progress tracking
```

### Script Naming Conventions
- **Managers**: `{system}_manager.py` (e.g., `character_manager.py`)
- **Controllers**: `{feature}_controller.py` (e.g., `customization_controller.py`) 
- **Data**: `{type}_data.py` (e.g., `student_data.py`, `outfit_data.py`)
- **UI**: `{component}_ui.py` (e.g., `character_customization_ui.py`)

## AI-Assisted Development Rules

### Code Generation Guidelines
- **Always use typed Python** with explicit types and null safety
- **Implement comprehensive error handling** for all user interactions
- **Create modular, reusable components** for character customization
- **Use JSON/YAML configuration** for data management
- **Follow SOLID principles** especially Single Responsibility

### Character AI Integration
- **Generate models from photos** using descriptive prompts about anime style
- **Create animation controllers** with smooth transitions between states
- **Implement reactive character behaviors** based on care status
- **Design emotional feedback systems** showing character responses

### Educational System Requirements
- **Homework assignment API integration** for school systems
- **Progress tracking with visual indicators** for student engagement  
- **Achievement system** encouraging consistent care and academic performance
- **Parental/teacher dashboard** for monitoring student progress

## Modern Blender Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Object pooling** for UI elements and particle effects
- **Efficient asset loading** using Blender's asset management
- **Desktop-first optimization** ensuring smooth performance across devices
- **Memory management** with proper disposal of temporary objects

### User Experience Design
- **Consistent visual hierarchy** with clear navigation
- **Accessibility considerations** including colorblind-friendly palettes
- **Intuitive mouse/touch interactions** with appropriate feedback
- **Responsive design** adapting to different screen sizes

## Examples

<example>
Creating a character customization script:
```python
import bpy
from bpy.types import Operator
from bpy.props import FloatProperty

class CharacterCustomization(Operator):
    """Operator for character customization"""
    bl_idname = "sangsom.character_customize"
    bl_label = "Customize Character"
    bl_options = {'REGISTER', 'UNDO'}
    
    # Scalable Features
    eye_size: FloatProperty(
        name="Eye Size",
        default=1.0,
        min=0.5,
        max=2.0
    )
    
    def execute(self, context):
        self.update_eye_size(context)
        self.load_student_customization()
        return {'FINISHED'}
    
    def update_eye_size(self, context):
        obj = context.active_object
        if obj:
            new_scale = 0.5 + self.eye_size
            obj.scale = (new_scale, new_scale, new_scale)
            self.save_customization()
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Avoid creating rigid, non-scalable character systems:
```python
# ❌ DON'T: Hard-coded, inflexible approach
class BadCharacter:
    hat1 = None
    hat2 = None
    hat3 = None  # Not scalable
    
    def change_hat(self, index):
        # Switch for each hat - not expandable
        pass
```
</example>
