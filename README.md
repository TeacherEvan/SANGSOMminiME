## 🌟 **Project Overview**

Sangsom Mini-Me combines modern AI-assisted development with educational game design to create personalized 3D tamagotchi-style characters for students. Using **VSCode** and **Blender 5.0.0**, we generate anime-style characters from student photos and integrate homework completion directly into character care mechanics.

### 🎯 **Core Features**

- **🤖 AI Character Generation**: Create anime-style 3D models from 2-3 reference photos
- **📚 Educational Integration**: Homework completion drives character wellbeing and unlocks resources
- **🎨 Extensive Customization**: Scalable eye sizes, outfits, accessories, and jewelry
- **🏫 Multi-User System**: School-wide deployment with administrative controls
- **🎮 Minime Universe**: Educational side games that contribute resources to main character
- **🔐 Administrative Tools**: Password-protected teacher controls and progress monitoring

## 🚀 **Modern Development Stack**

This project leverages cutting-edge AI-assisted development for maximum productivity:

- **Blender 5.0.0**: 3D modeling and animation with Python scripting
- **VSCode**: AI-powered code generation and debugging assistance  
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern scripting with type hints
- **Data-driven Architecture**: JSON/YAML configuration for scalability
- **Multi-Structural Folders**: Optimized project organization for performance

## ⚡ **Quick Start with VSCode**

### 1. **Setup Development Environment**

```bash
# Install Blender 5.0.0
# Download from: https://www.blender.org/download/

# Install VSCode Editor
# Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SANGSOMminiME.git
cd SANGSOMminiME
```

### 2. **Configure VSCode for Blender**

```bash
# Set VSCode as your external script editor for Blender Python development
# Open VSCode and configure Python language support

# Install Blender Python API stubs for better code completion
pip install blender-stubs
```

### 3. **AI-Assisted Development Setup**

The project includes pre-configured **VSCode rules** that will automatically:

- ✅ Generate Blender Python code following project standards
- ✅ Apply educational game design principles
- ✅ Create character customization systems
- ✅ Implement multi-user account management
- ✅ Build nurturing game mechanics without stress/timers

## 🧠 **AI-Powered Development Features**

### **Intelligent Code Generation**

Ask VSCode to:

```
"Create a character customization system with scalable eye sizes using Blender Python following SangsomMiniMe namespace conventions"

"Generate homework integration that increases character happiness when academic tasks complete"

"Build animation controller for Thai cultural gestures: wai, curtsy, bow with smooth transitions"
```

### **Educational Game Design**

The AI understands research-backed principles for educational gaming:

- **No stress mechanics**: No timers or failure states
- **Authentic nurturing**: Characters develop meaningful relationships with students
- **Academic integration**: Homework completion directly improves character wellbeing
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Proper implementation of Thai gestures (wai) and customs

## 👩‍🏫 **Phase 1: Leandi Test Model**

The first development phase creates a working prototype using **Leandi** (your wife) as the test subject:

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **📸 Photo Setup**: Upload 2-3 reference photos to `Assets/Characters/Leandi/Photos/`
2. **🤖 AI Generation**: Use VSCode to generate anime-style 3D model from photos
3. **🎨 Customization**: Implement eye size scaling and basic outfit system
4. **🎭 Animation**: Create dance, wave, wai, curtsy, and bow animations
5. **📚 Educational**: Connect character care to mock homework completion system

### **AI Prompts for Phase 1**

```
"Generate an anime-style 3D character model based on the photos in Assets/Characters/Leandi/Photos/ with customizable eye scaling and attachment points for accessories"

"Create a Blender animation controller for the Leandi character with smooth transitions between idle, dance, wave, wai, curtsy, and bow animations"

"Build a homework completion system that increases the Leandi character's happiness and unlocks new customization options"
```

## 🎮 **Game Design Philosophy**

e a character customization system with scalable eye sizes using Blender Python"
"Generate an educational homework integration system that rewards character care"
"Build a multi-user account system with password-protected admin controls"
"Create an anime-style character animation controller with cultural gestures"

### **Educational Nurturing Principles**

- **Cozy Gameplay**: Slow, meditative pace encouraging thoughtful interaction
- **Meaningful Progression**: Characters develop personality based on care patterns
- **Cross-Game Currency**: Resources from Minime Universe side games benefit main character
- **Administrative Oversight**: Teachers monitor engagement without invading student privacy

### **Technical Architecture**

- **Modular Design**: Systems work independently and together seamlessly
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling using Blender's event system and Python callbacks
- **Data-Driven**: JSON and YAML configuration for all content
- **Performance-First**: Mobile-optimized with 60fps target
