### 💡 **Three Priority Suggestions for Next Development Phase**

#### **1. Immediate: Leandi Character Generation Pipeline**
- **Upload reference photos** to `Assets/Characters/Leandi/Photos/` folder
- **Use Cursor AI** with the configured character generation prompts to create anime-style 3D model
- **Implement basic customization** starting with eye size scaling and outfit attachment system
- **Test AI-generated animation controller** with the five required gestures (dance, wave, wai, curtsy, bow)

#### **2. Short-term: Educational Integration Prototype**
- **Create mock homework completion system** that directly affects Leandi character's wellbeing
- **Build basic resource economy** where academic achievements unlock customization options
- **Implement character memory system** so Leandi remembers and celebrates student progress
- **Test nurturing mechanics** ensuring no stress/timer elements, only positive reinforcement

#### **3. Medium-term: Multi-User Foundation**
- **Develop administrative login system** with password protection for teacher controls
- **Create student account management** supporting multiple characters per classroom
- **Build progress monitoring dashboard** for teachers without invading student privacy
- **Implement cloud save system** for character data persistence across devices
